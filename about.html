    <h1><center>S2D01 - Music. Sound. Experience.</center></h1>

    <h1><center>A project by Simone Cappelli.</center></h1>
    
    <p>S2D01 is the inner space translated into sound.</p>
    
    <p>Born in Florence, the music project of Simone Cappelli blends ambient, downtempo, and experimental electronic into emotionally rich soundscapes.</p>
    
    <p>S2D01 stands for "Studio One", and want to be a tribute to Clement "Coxsone" Dodd, founder of "Studio One", one of Jamaica's most renowned record labels and recording studios.</p>
    
    <h1><center>BIO</center></h1>

    <p>Natural born singer in 1960, Simone's first spoken words were the lyrics of a song. By age 6 he was already a gifted guitarist playing by ear, obsessively chasing the perfect sound—even dismantling speakers to experiment with amplification.</p>

    <p>In 1971, he began formal classical guitar studies, and by 1977 was deep into the world of Hi-Fi and analog tape, crafting early mashups—known in NYC at the time as "Hollywoods." As a DJ, he spun Soul, Funk, and Motown on local TV, radio, and in clubs, while also distributing records for major labels.</p>

    <p>The '80s marked a creative expansion: from side music projects and a pivotal year in Paris (1985), to sound and light design for international theater companies. In 1987, a solo journey to Jamaica deeply shaped his taste for Black music, spinning vintage 45s at a beach bar and even modifying the sound system.</p>

    <p>By 1989, with his first sequencer, sampler, and Cubase on Atari, he began composing original soundtracks and music for visual arts and performances. His global travels continued into the 2000s, discovering lost melodic gems in the Philippines and developing a stronger emotional sensibility for music.</p>

    <p>Despite a difficult period between 2002 and 2007, Simone never stopped composing or collaborating. In 2008, he returned to the Philippines and reconnected with nature and creativity, sketching ideas in his DAW throughout seven peaceful, inspired years.</p>

    <p>In 2015, he launched S2D01 as an experimental online radio project with live reggae sets. By 2017, S2D01 had evolved into a full-fledged music identity—exploring remix culture, electronic music, cinematic atmospheres, and sound design with emotional depth.</p>
